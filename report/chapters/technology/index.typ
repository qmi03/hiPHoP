== jQuery and Pure JavaScript

=== Advantages
- Simplifies DOM manipulation and AJAX requests with concise syntax
- Broad browser compatibility and extensive plugin ecosystem
- Combined with pure JavaScript for optimal performance where needed
- Lightweight compared to full frameworks

=== Disadvantages
- Somewhat outdated compared to modern frameworks (React, Vue)
- Can lead to spaghetti code in larger applications if not properly structured
- Performance overhead for simple DOM operations compared to vanilla JS

== Tailwind CSS

=== Advantages
- Utility-first approach enables rapid UI development
- Highly customizable through configuration
- Reduces CSS file size in production with PurgeCSS
- Consistent design system through predefined values

=== Disadvantages
- Steep learning curve for developers used to traditional CSS
- HTML can become verbose with multiple utility classes
- Requires build process for optimal production performance

== MySQL

=== Advantages
- Reliable and well-established relational database
- Excellent documentation and community support
- Good performance for structured data
- Strong data integrity through ACID compliance

=== Disadvantages
- Scaling horizontally can be challenging
- Less flexible than NoSQL databases for rapidly changing data structures
- Performance can degrade with very large datasets without proper optimization

== PHP

=== Advantages
- Specifically designed for web development
- Easy to deploy and widely supported by hosting providers
- Large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks
- Simple learning curve for beginners

=== Disadvantages
- Inconsistent function naming conventions
- Performance limitations compared to compiled languages
- Type safety issues in older versions (improved in PHP 7+)

== AJAX

=== Advantages
- Enables asynchronous data loading without page refreshes
- Improves user experience with dynamic content updates
- Reduces server load by fetching only required data
- Seamless integration with jQuery

=== Disadvantages
- Can complicate application state management
- Requires careful error handling
- Potential accessibility issues if not implemented properly

== Security vulnerabilities and mitigations

=== SQL Injection

==== Vulnerability
Raw SQL queries with unsanitized user input allow attackers to manipulate database queries.

==== Mitigation
- Implemented prepared statements with parameter binding
- Used PDO with parameterized queries
- Applied input validation and sanitization
- Limited database user privileges

=== Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

==== Vulnerability
Unsanitized user input rendered as HTML/JavaScript allows attackers to inject malicious scripts.

==== Mitigation
- Applied context-appropriate output encoding (`htmlspecialchars()`)
- Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Used `HTTPOnly` cookies to prevent JavaScript access
- Validated and sanitized all user inputs

=== CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

==== Vulnerability

Attackers can trick users into performing unwanted actions on authenticated sessions.

==== Mitigation
- Implemented unique CSRF tokens for forms
- Validated token and origin on form submissions
- Added SameSite cookie attributes
- Required confirmation for sensitive operations

=== Session Hijacking

==== Vulnerability
Attackers can steal or manipulate session identifiers to impersonate legitimate users.

==== Mitigation
- Implemented secure session handling with session regeneration
- Used HTTPS throughout the application
- Applied proper session timeout controls
- Implemented IP-based session validation for critical operations

== SEO Optimization

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of improving a website's visibility and ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs). When implemented effectively, SEO helps increase organic (non-paid) traffic to your website by making it more attractive to search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.

Utilized strategies:
- Semantic HTML structure with appropriate heading hierarchy
- Server-side rendering for faster initial page loads
- Mobile-responsive design using Tailwind's responsive utilities
- Optimized meta tags (`title`, `description`, Open Graph)
- URL structure optimization with clean, descriptive URLs
- Image optimization with appropriate `alt` tags and lazy loading
