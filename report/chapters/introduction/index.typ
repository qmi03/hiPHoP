Music is our passion. As an idea, we have incorporated music into this assignment, and built a music instrument ecommerce website.

We're directly inspired by the design of the MusicPlace (https://musicplace.com/), which is a website that aims to teach children music courses. The design is bright, colorful and friendly, so we decided to challenge ourselves with this design. This website mainly acts as a marketing media that is within accessible reach to everyone. It contains information about various courses, snippets of their classes and user reviews. It also shows guidance on how to register their courses and provide customer service.

Our website is similar to theirs in the interface, but we're focused on the ecommerce aspect: our website acts as a platform that customers can view and purchase music instruments, instead of for pure informational purposes. Besides that, our website also contains various marketing information.

The stack we've chosen:
- Vanilla Javascript for the frontend, with the aid of jquery.
- TailwindCSS for ease of building user-friendly and responsive websites.
- Pure PHP backend.
- MySQL as the database management system.
