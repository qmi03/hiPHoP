= C++11 Multithreading <cpp11>

C++11 (ISO/IEC 14882:2011) introduced native support for multithreading directly
in the Standard Template Library (STL) @williams2019c. This eliminated the
previous reliance on platform-specific threading libraries like POSIX thread
(pthread) and the Microsoft Windows API, offering a more portable and
standardized approach to parallel computing. The introduction of these features
marked a significant advancement in C++ development, providing developers with
powerful, standardized tools for concurrent and parallel programming.
