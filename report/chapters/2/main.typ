Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive background on the fundamental technologies
underlying the research: Message Passing Interface (MPI) and C++11
Multithreading. The chapter explores these technologies within the context of
high-performance computing, laying the groundwork for understanding the hybrid
programming model proposed in the thesis.
